system-config-printer-kde is a port of Red Hat's Gnome system-config-printer to KDE.

It currently misses quite a few features compared to the Gnome version but should be usable.

It needs some files from the Gnome version config.py, cupshelpers.py, ppds.py, smburi.py, debug.py 
(in Ubuntu we package these into system-config-printer-common)

Gnome version homepage:
 http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/system-config-printer/
Gnome version source:
 git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/system-config-printer.git

It assumes the system-config-printer files are installed to /usr/share/system-config-printer, if not edit SYSTEM_CONFIG_PRINTER_DIR in system-config-printer-kde.py

It also needs pycups:

TODO:
    implement all the missing features from system-config-printer
    - printer options pages
    - printer access control page
    - browsing SMB
    - verifying IPP
    - driver download
    - many more, grep for TODO and FIXME

    Make UI follow Celeste's spec in kubuntu_printer_configuration.pdf

    Merge code as far as possible with system-config-printer to stop code duplication, host in same archive too
